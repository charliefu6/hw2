==

the solution for problems one, two, and four are respectively found in hw2P1.txt, hw2P2.txt and hw2q4.txt

the solution for problem 5 is in hw2q5.cpp. it should compile with a g++ command. hw2p5_followup.txt then contains an analysis of the recursive and iterative function run speeds. the recursive runtime was significantly slower.

the solution for problem 6 is in hw2q6.cpp. it should also compile with a g++ command.

all programming solutions should run correctly.
